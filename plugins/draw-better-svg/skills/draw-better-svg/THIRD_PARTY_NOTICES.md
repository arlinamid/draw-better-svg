draw-better-svg is MIT-licensed. Two reference files adapt material from other
projects under their own licenses. No code from these projects is included; the

## svg-creator-skill (Apache-2.0)

`references/effects.md` adapts filter, gradient, material, and atmosphere recipes
from `references/advanced-techniques.md` of
[upbrew-tech/svg-creator-skill](https://github.com/upbrew-tech/svg-creator-skill).

Changes: recipes were re-tested in three renderers; the texture, lighting, glass,
wood, stone, and template recipes were rewritten to fix defects found in testing;
parameters were retuned; failing and redundant recipes were removed.

## pixel2motion (MIT)

`references/motion.md` adapts the motion brief, personality presets, timeline
shape, pattern library, and QA approach of
[nolangz/pixel2motion](https://github.com/nolangz/pixel2motion).
`scripts/path_audit.py` follows its idea of auditing joins and segments with a
handle overlay, in an independent implementation.

## svg-hand-drawn-skill

The construction reveal in `scripts/preview_html.mjs` was inspired by the idea of
[shaom/svg-hand-drawn-skill](https://github.com/shaom/svg-hand-drawn-skill) (draw
strokes, then reveal fills). That repository has no license file; none of its code
or text is used.
